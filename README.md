## Binary trees
- Instructions
    1. all in a single repo called binary_trees
    2. uses these flags during compilation `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89`
    3. passes all betty coding style
    4. this readme file is present
    5. use the provided header file
    6. no more than 5 function per file
    7. allowed to use all stdlib files
    8. you will be working only with binary trees alone

##### Notes
- Please make sure you are using all the user defined datastructure members
- Parent is a pointer to the parent tree node it needs to always be there, same as a doubly linked list
- Using recursion to repeate all the tasks in a rabbit hole
- Balanced algorithm is just modified postorder function where you are looking for the balance of right and left subtree
